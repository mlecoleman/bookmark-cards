# bookmark-cards

ReadMe as of 6:00pm Sun July 24th:

Hello!

I'm doing this as a preliminary ReadMe for whoever might review my project prior to the deadline.

This is what I have so far and... it's ok?

I believe all you need to run it is to enter these commands in the terminal:

    python -m pip install flask
    export FLASK_APP=bookmarks.py
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run

Then open the link provided in the terminal.

I know the html and css are awful, but at this point I'm just trying to get a minimally viable project, so that's last on my list.

Requirements:
1. Read in Data - Does reading in the user inputs into a json file and creating the bookmark cards count?
2. Manipulate Data - Does taking in the data and listing it in my app count? I do use the url input to make the title input display as a link in the bookmark card?
3. Analyze Data - I want to try to use the category inputs to sort the data, haven't figured that out yet.
4. Visualize Data - Again, does creating an app count? I have been trying to figure out how to list the cards by category but haven't gotten there yet, would that count?
5. Interpret your Data - My goal is to make an app that creates useful bookmark cards that can be sorted through.


Thank you for reviewing this!  It's a bit of a mess right now, but I'm doing my best to chip away at it.
