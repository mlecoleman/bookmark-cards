# bookmark-cards

Hello Code Louisville!

My project can be easily run at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IkynTQEpIm2RTdu53KHjE2swzqMLz1YH#scrollTo=dCYARtVlfwON
This link should also be included in the Code Louisville google form I used to submit my project.

The code for it is also present in this repo inside of the bookmarks folder.  Pleas disregard all other items as extra-credit... more context below.

I am a bookmarks and resources lover, but the way browsers allow you to store bookmarks doesn't work super well for me.  
I wanted to create a Flask website where I could add bookmarks into a database that held not just the bookmark title and URL, but also a paragraph description, image, and also categorized the bookmarks.
I then wanted the Flask site to display this information in cards that could be either searched or at least organized in a way that made it easy to find what I was looking for.
I made a stab at it first with this repo (https://github.com/mlecoleman/bookmarks) and then with this current repo.
Flask proved to be too big of a hurdle for me to tackle before the deadline, so instead I'm submitting a bare-bones version that will hopefully get me across the finish line, but again I've included my unfinished flask files just to show my work. 


Requirements:
1. Read in Data - Read in data from a csv file of bookmarks.
2. Manipulate Data - Gave the bookmark columns headers and also deleted two columns that had incomplete data.
3. Analyze Data - Printed out total number of bookmarks, searched for how many times certain keywords appeared, and printed the number of rows that contained certain keywords.
4. Visualize Data - Created a bar graph that shows how many bookmarks pertaining to certain keywords are in my CSV of bookmarks.
5. Interpret your Data - My ultimate goal is to make an app that creates useful bookmark cards that can be sorted through so that I can have an easier job of organizing and finding resources I have saved.
